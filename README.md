# hello-world
This is just to learn how GitHub works! :)
I'm a student in the university of Barcelona, where I live, and I'm glad to say I'm on my last year of my degree, though this is quite weird, because it seems it was yesterday when I started, but I'm a bit afraid of finishing so soon too..
However, this is gonna be the best year ever! :)
